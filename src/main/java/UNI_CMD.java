//This class was created so that we can store universal commands that every class can call. Ex: readLine(), readInt() etc. This was needed because these commands were not already in replits database, like they were in codehs' databse.
//Separate commands and docs were added by Brayden and Hanna. Some edits were made and some debugging was required.
